shower we have to get change downstairs 3 There was no electric socket for the use of hairdryer in the shower room 4 The air conditioner vent was facing the pillows and we have to switch off the air conditioner when we went to bed 5 On our 2nd stay morning there was some muddy water flushing out from the shower head this was ridiculous and at the end we were late for our meeting 6 There was limited choice of the breakfast and the services was bad We ve ordered the salmon bagel and end up getting some bacon Besides my husband ordered a boiled egg for each of us and at the end 2 boiled eggs was served for each of us The scramble egg was dry and tasteless 7 My husband felt sick and we asked the reception to call for the SOS doctor and replied to us the expected arrival time of the doctor After 15 mins no reply and we have to call back the reception to follow up with them 8 After arriving I was unpacking and my husband was taking a shower on the upper deck of the room We heard

allowed us to use the shower in the gym in the afternoon when we came back to get our suitcases which was great because there was a heatwave on our last day b The hotel can arrange a shuttle to take you to the airport this is reasonably priced and much easier than using underground trains This is not a hotel which has a lot of facilities like a restaurant or outside patio but that is not what we
