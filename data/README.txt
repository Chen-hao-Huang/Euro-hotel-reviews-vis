Use hotel_data_test.csv and hotel_test.json to do designing now. 

Since we are changing dataset layout right now, I will update it at final. 

Then use hotel_reviews.csv and hotel_reviews.json when everything is done! ( it is too large!!!)

TODO:
Edits to the data file:
- change "stayed _ nights" to just an integer for nights stayed
- remove leading and trailing whitespace in some cells

Visualizations to make:
- geographic visualization -C
- D3 bar graphs
- (possibly) D3 pie charts, word clouds (check proposed solutions)

*After making visualizations:
Write-ups/presentation:
- link and test live demo in presentation
- backup snapshots of demo in case live demo issues
- (optional) Evaluation
