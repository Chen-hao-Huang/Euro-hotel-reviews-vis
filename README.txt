Use hotel_data_test.csv and hotel_test.json in the data folder are used for designing right now.
hotel_info_test.csv is the info of each of the hotels in the test dataset.

Since we are changing dataset layout right now, I will update it at final. 

Then use hotel_reviews.csv and hotel_reviews.json when everything is done! ( it is too large!!!)
